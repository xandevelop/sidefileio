A library for reading Selenium IDE files into C# objects.

Selenium IDE is deprecated (as of now in Chrome at least) and newer tools like Playwright aren't backwards compatible - this gives a library of types so that old selenium IDE export files which are JSON structured can be read, analysed as needed, and perhaps even converted to newer test formats.
